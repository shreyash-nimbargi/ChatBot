# 🤖 GenAI Learning Playlist 🚀

This repo is my personal learning journey from a **Generative AI**.  
I’m following along with the tutorials, building projects, experimenting with tools like OpenAI, LangChain, Hugging Face, and more — and documenting everything here 📚💻

## 📺 I'm Learning


I'm learning GenAI concepts like:
- LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Prompt Engineering
- LangChain
- Embeddings & Vector Databases (like FAISS, Pinecone)
- Chatbots & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Streamlit / Gradio for UI

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

This repo is:
- My notebook 💡
- My playground 🧪
- My portfolio 💼

I'm using it to **track progress**, **practice coding**, and **share what I build** while learning GenAI from scratch.
